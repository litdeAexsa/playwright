## What is Universe Sandbox 2?
  
Universe Sandbox 2 is a sequel to the popular Universe Sandbox game, which was released in 2011. Unlike its predecessor, Universe Sandbox 2 comes with new features and graphics, making it more realistic and immersive. It is not just a game, but also a learning tool that teaches you about astrophysics, space, and gravity.
  
Universe Sandbox 2 does not have any fixed mission or objective. You are free to do whatever you want with the Universe. You can place rocks in space and change their physical properties, such as mass, density, velocity, etc. You can also alter the laws of physics and see how they affect the objects in space. You can collide planets and stars, create your own solar systems, watch supernovas unfold, explore historical events, and much more.
  
Universe Sandbox 2 has a user-friendly interface that lets you easily navigate through the game. You can also use VR mode to experience the game in a more immersive way. You can use HTC Vive, Oculus Rift+Touch, or Windows Mixed Reality to play Universe Sandbox 2 in VR.
  
## What are the features of Universe Sandbox 2?
  
Universe Sandbox 2 has many features that make it one of the best space simulators available. Some of them are:
  
- Simulate gravity: You can simulate gravity using Newtonian mechanics at almost any speed. You can see how gravity affects the objects in space and how it shapes the Universe.
- Collide planets and stars: You can create epic collisions of massive planetary bodies and see how they affect each other. You can also witness the destruction caused by asteroids, comets, or lasers.
- Create your own systems: You can start with a star and then add planets, moons, rings, comets, or even a black hole. You can customize your systems with different materials, colors, textures, etc.
- Model Earth's climate: You can watch how the seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth. You can also change the tilt or move the Earth farther or closer to the Sun and see how it affects the climate.
- Supernova a star: You can make a star evolve by changing its age or mass and then watch it explode in a spectacular supernova.
- Explore historical events: You can ride along with the Juno and New Horizons spacecraft or view a total solar eclipse. You can also learn about the history of space exploration and discovery.
- Material system: You can build planets out of hydrogen, iron, rock, water, or other materials. You can also see how different materials interact with each other and with light.
- Stellar flares and volatile trails: You can see how stars emit flares and how comets leave trails behind them as they orbit around the Sun.
- Procedurally generated planets, stars, and galaxies: You can explore randomly generated worlds that are unique and realistic. You can also create your own galaxies with different shapes and sizes.
- Pulsars: You can see how pulsars spin rapidly and emit beams of radiation from their poles.
- Light-warping black holes: You can see how black holes bend light around them and create gravitational lensing effects.
- Support for 20+ languages: You can play Universe Sandbox 2 in your preferred language from a list of over 20 languages available.
- Share and explore simulations on Steam Workshop: You can share your creations with other players on Steam Workshop or download simulations made by others.
